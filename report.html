      <h1>Project 1 Report</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a website that helps an organization while also
        having some relation to me. I decided to create a Phi Psi basketball
        website for my fraternity so that we can use this in the future for our
        internal basketball league.
      </p>
      <p>
        To go down the list of what I have done, I will start with the five
        basic pages. The first page is the index home page that all users will
        be directed to when they enter the URL. The other four pages include an
        about page that explains how the league started and what this website is
        used for. A teams page to show which teams are in the league. A
        standings page to see the current standings of the teams. And finally a
        contact us page for people to reach out to me if they have questions or
        concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next I have a header that includes the navigation for the the website.
        From there, I also included media queries to minimize the amount of
        contact when a user visits the page on a mobile device. Other than that,
        the images are kept in an images folder where the images have alts to
        explain the images to users that do not have the image loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSS animation that was included in the project has to do with the
        navigation. When a user hovers over one of the nav links the link will
        slowly change colors. All names of the files are undercase and the Git
        repository is shared to hscientist.When you are directed to the page it
        is secured with HTTPS.
