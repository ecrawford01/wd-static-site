I thought the website was very well put together, and serves its purpose effectively. I also liked how when you hover a link it changes the color. The main difference
between my site and yours is that we are serving two different purposes. I think both of our code bases are very maintainable, but you were able to get all of your website's
css into a single file which probably shows that you didn't repeat css that could be reused throughout your site. The code for both your HTML and CSS files is very
well structed and easily readable. Overall it looks great.
