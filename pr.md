1.) I really liked how you kept the navlinks at the top of the webpage 
    uniform with the Phi Psi logo in the top left corner. When I resize
    the page the navlinks also collapse into a column which is nice.
2.) Our websites are different because mine is a portfolio that showcases
    artwork and yours showcases the Phi Psi basketball league and what
    they are about. I think both of our websites have similar user 
    experiences because we have navlinks at the top. I think your codebase
    is more maintainable because I have multiple CSS files for different 
    pages while you only have one stylesheet for all of your pages.
3.) The code is somewhat organized, even though you only have one CSS file
    I think you should still place it into a CSS folder. The images are 
    organized into a folder so that is organized.
4.) One issue I found is that when I view your webpage in a mobile browser
    the Phi Psi logo disappears, and some formatting gets lost. In your
    code, elements were organized very well into divs that made sense.
    Since there is only one CSS file, there are no duplication problems
    regarding style. You also don't have any apparent CSS animations on 
    your page as well. 
5.) As a whole your website and its code is organized very well. I think
    as you go on, you should try and code your website for mobile browser
    view first and then work your way up to formatting it for desktop 
    viewing next.
